# Android Launch Arguments



### Use Case

- Any app that sends data to a custom package



### Demo

* YouTube Revanced allows the download intent to be sent to any package ID, not just NewPipe. I used this app to see what data it was sending (just the video URL) by swapping the package name.



### Package Name

* _com.imaperson.launcharguments_
